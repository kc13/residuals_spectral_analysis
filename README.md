# residuals_spectral_analysis

This repository shares the Matlab code associated with the preprint "Detecting rhythmic spiking through the power spectra of point process model residuals."

This version, 0.2.0, represents the 3rd pre-release of the code. A new release will be published once the preprint is posted to bioRxiv, and the preprint DOI will be provided here.

This code enables regeneration of all manuscript figures and tables, and the analyses and simulations that inform them. Additional documentation regarding the code is available in the "figures", "tables", and "other_analyses" folders. All Matlab files were originally generated using version R2022a, and draw upon multiple optional toolboxes that Mathworks provides for that version. 

The majority of the code is original to this repository. An exception is the code located in the Modified-Spline-Regression folder. This code was obtained from https://github.com/MehradSm/Modified-Spline-Regression. See the documentation inside the folder for more details. 

For the remaining, original code, contributors include Karin Cox, Daisuke Kase, and Rob Turner, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh.
