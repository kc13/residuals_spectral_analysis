The result indicating slightly better performance for the
indicators based residuals method over the spline implementation
is found by loading 'subsample1000_stdFR_stdRP_splines.mat'
and viewing the statsF and related structs, which were outputs of 
a paired t-test comparing the indicators-spline pAUC values for 
the matched spike trains. "F" refers to the fact that the pROC
curves were cropped to span identical ranges along the FA axis.
