The result indicating slightly better performance for the
global versus local shuffling implementations
is found by loading 'subsample1000_res_shufG_shufL.mat'
and viewing the statsF and related structs, which were outputs of 
paired t-tests comparing the pAUC differences for all possible 
combinations of global and local shuffling (G,L) and the residuals
method (R). The order of the method codes in the struct fields
indiates the specific pAUC differences that were tested (e.g., 
GL = global shuffling pAUCs - local shuffling pAUCs).
"F" refers to the fact that the pROC curves were cropped 
to span identical ranges along the FA axis.
