The code in these folders will recreate two results that were not represented in any figures or tables: the comparison of the indicators-based residuals method to the spline-based implementation, and the comparison of global and local shuffling. To regenerate the final results of these comparisons, run the .m files prefixed with "run_subsample_and_ROC". These code files will expand the Matlab search path with addpath() calls so that the necessary code dependencies from the other folders, and the input data files (.mat) are located automatically, assuming maintenance of the repository's file organization. 

These folders include the information stored regarding the subsampled simulation output. To access non-subsampled output, it will be necessary to either recreate the simulations using the scripts that are made available, or access the synthetic data files stored in the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8276683).
