When running run_residuals_nhp_data.m: Note that warnings
concerning rank deficiency do not apply to the core analyses 
necessary for execution of the residuals method, but are the 
result of additional models fit to aid in the generation
of illustrations.  In the recovery period estimation step,
a series of right-shifted exponential curves are fit to the 
interspike interval distribution. Deviance difference stats
are recorded as a function of the fit's starting position, 
and the process can be aborted as soon as a local maximum in 
the deviance difference is detected. In the current 
implementation, however, the fitting process is performed
for all starting positions, to aid in the generation of 
visualizations of how the deviance difference statistic
varies. Towards the end of this process, some models will 
be flagged as rank deficient. These models have no impact
on the reported figures/results in the manuscript.
