To regenerate a figure, navigate to the corresponding folder in the figures directory, and run the .m file prefixed with "fig". Some of the figure folders include additional code files that may be used to recreate relevant simulations or analyses. The code files will expand the Matlab search path with addpath() calls so that the necessary code dependencies from the other folders, and the input data files (.mat) are located automatically, assuming maintenance of the repository's file organization. 

For most scripts, any needed .mat files are already present in the same folder as the script itself. A limited number of exceptions are (a) scripts that draw directly upon the original (non-subsampled) simulation output that was generated for method evaluation, and (b) the script used to generate inputs to Fig. S17. These .mat files are large, and so are not stored in this repository. They may be either regenerated using the appropriate script in the folder, or by accessing the .mat files in the Zenodo data repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8313070).

For the simulation and subsampling code, information about the random number generator seeds used for the manuscript simulations is provided when available, but in some cases this may not be sufficient to exactly recreate identical output.  This is due to the use of parfor loops in the code.  See https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/repeat-random-numbers-in-parfor-loops.html for more information.
